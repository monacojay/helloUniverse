I hated every course I ever took.
This is the curriculum I wish I had.

Course .1 - Vocab
Course .2 - Data Types
Course .3 - Conditionals
Course .4 - Functions


Vocab Course for Heidi

The first hurdle I had in learning tech was all the technical jargon.
So, run vocab.py and learn a little lingo to get started.


TODO
- Make a matching game to connect the term with its corresponding definition. 
- Rewrite readme to be directions for each course
